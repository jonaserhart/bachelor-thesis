## Abstract

Agile methods are widely used in project development today, offering flexible frameworks that can adapt to different projects.
However, these methods, especially SCRUM, rely heavily on continuous evaluation and process adaptation.
SCRUM uses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to provide feedback for teams to improve their development process.
This thesis explores the importance of having a comprehensive set of KPIs for agile teams, focusing on identifying the essential KPIs for evaluating team performance in SCRUM.
The research question that is answered in this thesis is to find out if such a set of essential KPIs can be defined or if teams would benefit from more customized KPIs for their sprints.
A prototype application will be developed in cooperation with a local company.
This application will offer teams that use digital SCRUM planning software a personalized analysis of their performance.
Following the Design Science Research methodology, the application will be systematically designed and evaluated by the company.
The ultimate aim is to contribute to improving the SCRUM experience for agile teams.
As the application evolves, it is expected to benefit not only the collaborating company but also become a useful resource for other teams looking to enhance their SCRUM practices.

This research and development process demonstrates a commitment to advancing the understanding and implementation of SCRUM in project development.
