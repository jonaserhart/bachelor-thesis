Je unsicherer ein Ticket, desto geringe die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass dieses innerhalb des Sprints vollständig abgearbeitet wird.
Wie genau das erfasst bzw. bestimmt werden sollte, ist mir zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt nicht vollends bewusst, aber eine Korrelation der für das Ticket geplanten StoryPoints, die Kapazität der bearbeitenden Person und die Anzahl an ""freien Tagen"" könnten einige der Faktoren sein."
